All theories explain the criminal behaviour but psychological analysis move one step forward than others and link the violence/brutality associated in a crime with criminal behaviour. Criminologists need theories which can explain each and every aspects of criminal behaviour. Firstly, a theory is needed which can label some act as a crime - labelling theory. Second theory is needed which can differentiate violent and non-violent. Third theory: which can measure the level of brutality or violence associated with a crime as well as explanation of behaviour associated with the different levels.… We are all responsible for our own actions, but if something is affecting the brain from doing its job, does that give the criminal an excuse? Caitlin Jones, at the Rochester Institute of Technology, states, “Personality traits and disorders have recently become essential in the diagnosis of individuals with antisocial or criminal behavior. These traits and disorders do not first become evident when an individual is an adult, rather these can be seen in children” (Jones, 2005). Mental illnesses such as PTSD, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disease all affect how we behave, and many show up in childhood, so it would be beneficial to look at these mental illnesses immediately. These children should receive the proper care and love to help them through their illness, so they do not portray criminal behavior as an adult.… The Rehabilitation perspective believe that all criminal behavior is caused by some factor in your life. They believe that the choices criminals make are based on there surroundings and how they live there personal life. They believe that when people are characterized as being exposed to delinquents and lack parental support they are more likely to become criminals. There point of view doesn’t deny that everyone makes there own decisions but they absolutely don’t go into a irrational choice of pure “free will.” In order for someone to change the way they view things they would need to have been in a circumstance where two perspectives where  demonstrated . This perspective views crime as a something that is rarely free willed and that is why particular individuals can be rehabilitated.… Every person learns through observation, but in some cases what people learn can be the cause of why people turn out to be criminals. For example, learning violence and aggression make people feel that it is okay to commit crimes because that’s what criminals were educated when they were young. Overall, there is a huge difference between criminals and regular people, but the impact can be because of different life… The Routine Activity                          theory deals with crimes of opportunities and perfect chances. The Self-Control theory deals with crime                          of passion or impulsiveness. So, both theories deal with crime that happens for different reasons. The                          Routine Activity theory also deals with offenders who plan out their crimes. They take time to plan and                          think about what they are doing.… What the suspect leaves behind or purposely doesn’t leave behind, tells law enforcement a lot about their distinct personality. For example: crime scenes that are disorganized with evidence left behind may mean that they’re psychotic and unintelligent while organized scenes point to a more intelligent offender who has carefully plotted his attacks and taken care of evidence. Knowing background information may seem like a secondary priority but in cases where the suspect left little to no evidence, behavioral clues is vital for their… It include offenses such as assault, murder, robbery, and kidnapping. Psychopathy can be associated to both instrumental and reactive aggression (Pardue). Instrumental aggression is when violence is used to accomplish a certain outcome and reactive aggression is violence that is triggered by a stressful event (Pardue). Street crime usually is directed and deliberate and causes harm. While street crime is an area of crime that psychopaths lean towards which should not be overlooked, psychopaths are also linked to other types of crime such as corporate crime.… If prisons are anything like the fake one in “The Stanford Prison Experiment”, then it would seem like someone with a minor offense like drug-dealing definitely served their time. This case emphasizes the fact that there is a really blurred line between victim and offender because sometimes the offender becomes a victim and the people that we trust to ensure there are fewer offenses, sometimes end up committing offenses themselves. What the criminal justice system does is surely not perfect: prison guards are sometimes quite cruel and criminals are judged for the rest of their lives for something they likely did when they were young and careless. This case displays a part of humanity that many of us would rather… The other difficulty in criminal profiling is the ability to link the evidence at the crime scene to an accurate profile without guessing or making assumptions (Miller, 2011). When creating an offender profile, personality and behavioral traits are the key factors; however, a person experiences many forms of moods and this probes the validity and reliability of using the two factors. Moreover, different persons have varied personalities depending on the circumstances they… The crime model heavily relies on the ability of investigative and prosecutorial officers, they might use their distinctive skills to elicit and reconstruct a tolerably accurate account of alleged criminal event that took place. The due process model emphasizes on a view of formal and adjudicative fact-finding process with stressing the possibility of errors. People, such as police, witness and prosecutorial officers, tend to be emotionally aroused in the context with notoriously poor observers of disturbing events so as to damage defendants’ rights. As a result, the further scrutiny to largely avoid the possibilities of human errors is very necessary or at least must be available.
